    <p>My Day</p>

So, I was heading to school today, and I couldn't believe what was waiting for
me when I left the house... Even if it looks like you doing something that is altruistic. You can help your friend move or you can go with other group of your friend and have a good time. Once of a time, I was a undergraduate. My friend ask me to go Calgary. But I need to be in a grading meeting. The professor ask me what you should do? He say.. yes. Have a great time. Typically enjoying yourself is .. what you should do. You should not help your fiend move but doing something else. Lets say.. We kind of in our common day decided going party is more for your interest but not helping your friend. Psychological egoism would say even you go help you friend move would be your choice and since it is the thing that you wanted to do the most. That is come out of your self-interest. As long as you doing it, it trivially says that is what you want to do most.  Can you disprove it?

I am starting to settle in to the new semester. So far, my classes look...You can help your friend move or you can go with other group of your friend and have a good time. Once of a time, I was a undergraduate. My friend ask me to go Calgary. But I need to be in a grading meeting. The professor ask me what you should do? He say.. yes. Have a great time.
