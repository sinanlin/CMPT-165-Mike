<h1>Pages Designs</h1> 
<h2>Major page</h2>
<p>For my site's main page, I wanted a design that can deliver the major information about what this website is about, content, contack and copyright. So,for the parts of the page, I will make the gray part a logo display area. The dark part will be a menue. The orange part will be contact information and extra link. The blue part will be the major content of the website. Purple will be about copyright and so on. </p>
    <div class="figure">
     <img src="Page2.jpg" alt="Design page2." width="500" height="400"/>
    </div>
<P>
Rroximity:The manue will be on the top of the pages. Contact and extra link will be on the organge area. Major content will be focus on the middle. Other things link copyright will be on the bottom of the pages.
    </P>    
<p>
Alignment:The overall alignment of the page will be design to follow the proposed picture. The organge part and the blue part should be aligned.</p>    
    
<p>
Repetition:The overall color theme of the page would be in red. </p>
    
<p>
Contrast: The major content of the page would be in different front and size and brighter colour so as to contrast with the rest of the content.</p>
    
<h2>Image gallary pages</h2>    
<p>The image gallery page on my site will be based on this design which I want to have the logo display area and the menue bar and the copyright area remain intact. The light organge part, however, will be change into picutre display area. The green part would be some content to explain the picture.</p>

    </div>
